# Machine Learning Nanodegree program

## Udacity

This repository contains three reviewed projects which I had to pass in order to fulfill requirements and pass term 1 of **Udacity's Nanodegree  Machine Learning Engineer studies.**

Program was built around projects. When each project was completed, it was submitted to one of the Udacity's expert reviewers who give me a personalized feedback. These projects helped me gain valuable experience and build a portfolio of projects.

Below are the projects that were completed complete during the first term of the Machine Learning Nanodegree program:

### **Model Evaluation Validation: Predicting Boston Housing Prices**

I utilized scikit learn and regression to analyze a real dataset of housing prices in Boston. I had built and optimized a model to predict the price of houses, based on their features.

### **Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML**

My task was to build a classification model to identify the best potential donors for a charity. Here I utilized several classification algorithms and optimized them for quality.

### **Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments**

In this project I studied a real dataset of customers for a company. Here I applied several unsupervised learning techniques in order to extract valuable information from the data.
