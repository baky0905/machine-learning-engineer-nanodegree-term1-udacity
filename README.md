This repository contains three reviewed projects which I had to pass in order to fulfill requirements and pass term 1 of **Udacity's Nanodegree  Machine Learning Engineer studies.**

 Program was built around projects. When each project was completed, it was submitted to one of the Udacity's expert reviewers who give me a personalized feedback. These projects helped me gain valuable experience and build a portfolio of projects.

Below are the projects that were completed complete during the first term of the Machine Learning Nanodegree program:

**Model Evaluation Validation: Predicting Boston Housing Prices**
I utilized scikit learn and regression to analyze a real dataset of housing prices in Boston. I had built and optimized a model to predict the price of houses, based on their features.

**Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML**
My task was to build a classification model to identify the best potential donors for a charity. Here I utilized several classification algorithms and optimized them for quality.
